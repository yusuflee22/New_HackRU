fetch_tea_staar.py
===================

This module contains helper routines for acquiring and preparing Texas STAAR
aggregate data from the Texas Education Agency (TEA).  The STAAR (State of
Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness) program publishes performance
statistics for each campus and district annually, including the percentage of
students meeting or exceeding proficiency benchmarks.  These data provide a
quantitative proxy for education quality that can be aggregated to a city level
for our housing appreciation model.

The TEA does not provide a simple public API for bulk downloads of STAAR
results, so this script implements two strategies:

1. **Attempt to download via known URLs.**  Some annual datasets may be hosted
   at stable links.  When a direct link is available for a given year, the
   script will download the CSV and save it to ``data/raw/tea_staar/``.

2. **Prompt the user for manual downloads.**  If a year cannot be
   automatically retrieved, the script prints detailed instructions for the
   researcher to follow.  Typically this involves visiting the TEA Research
   Portal, selecting the STAAR aggregate data for the desired year, and
   exporting district and campus CSVs.  Once downloaded, these files should
   be saved in ``data/raw/tea_staar/`` using the naming convention
   ``staar_{year}_district.csv`` and ``staar_{year}_campus.csv``.

Additionally, this module exposes a ``standardize_staar_columns`` function that
renames common STAAR fields to canonical names (e.g., ``city``, ``enrollment``,
``pct_meets``, ``pct_masters``) so that downstream scripts can process files
from different years uniformly.

Usage::

    python src/fetch_tea_staar.py --years 2018 2019 2020

The above example will attempt to download the 2018â€“2020 STAAR CSVs.  For years
that cannot be fetched automatically, it will print instructions for manual
retrieval.
